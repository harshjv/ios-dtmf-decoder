# Dreadtech iOS DTMF Decorder

Turns your iPhone into a simple DTMF decoder. Simply hold the iPhone's microphone near to a source of DTMF tones (telephone "Touch Tones") and it will display the numbers being dialed. Version 1.8 not only has a far superior decoding engine, but it also allows you to tweak the sensitivity. You may copy the decoded digits to the clipboard from the text area.
